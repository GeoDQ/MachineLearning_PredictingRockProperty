# MachineLearning_PredictingRockProperty
In this exercise I show the workflow of predicting rock properties using multi-attribute regression, including:
## 1) Data preparation 
Import data, understand and visualize the data, split dataset, data transformation
## 2) Model training and selection
Which regression model with which hyperparameter to use?
## 3) Testing the performance of the selected model.
