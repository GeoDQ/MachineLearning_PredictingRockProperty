# MachineLearning_PredictingRockProperty
In this exercise I show the workflow of predicting rock properties using Machine Learning methods, including:
# Data preparation 
Import data, understand and visualize the data, split dataset, data transformation
# Model training and selection
Which regression model with which hyperparameter to use?
# Testing the performance of the selected model.
